{"body":"They seem like cheap stabs because the images are so aberrant. But the aberrant behavior continues behind closed doors, even if it doesn't always manifest itself to outsiders. My dad made me burn books that were not Christian (Bourne Identity, specifically). My mother made me put a Magic Eye book on the porch because she didn't understand how it worked and she didn't want the demons inside it to invade her house. My parents were not the only ones I knew who were like that. Crazy shit is going on all around you dude, take it from me. The craziness manifests itself on a massive scale with climate-change denial, the jingoistic support of Israel, etc. The craziness only subsides when the evidence is overwhelming and irrefutable. Sometimes that's too late. 	  	Here's the trick: they are able to justify their behavior using the teachings of whatever book they adopted. These fucking monotheistic holy books are like boxes of rhetorical Lego blocks, which their adherents manipulate and retrofit to their own purposes. Why do you think we've had this burgeoning,  this *evolution* if you will, of so many antagonistic religious teachings? 	    	Their reasoning was internally consistent too. Even I could see that when I translated their sermons into English. It was consistent according to the axioms they built it on. But it is precisely this feature of holy texts - that they lend themselves so easily to manipulation - that makes them dangerous and hateful to me. Religion allows you to start with dangerous axioms - that faith has primacy over reason, for instance - and then construct an ideology with no evidence. (Try something: next time someone tells you that it is important to have faith,  ask them why *faith* is good, and where its goodness comes from. If they don't budge, call them out when they later inevitably appeal to logic to help their "argument". You won't win at first, but logic works like erosion. I recently got my parents to admit that the Earth *may* be older than 6,000 years old).	  	The first time I opened Dawkins' God Delusion,  I felt nervous, like I was committing a sin, but at 20 years old nobody could make me burn a book anymore. But that is how well these people had trained me. They used Old Testament Scriptures from Numbers and Leviticus about shunning unclean,  polluted things to codify Confirmation Bias. It's all a very subtle, specious rhetorical construction. They're full of bullshit - all adherents of religion. Krauss said moral wisdom is not the province of any one person or belief system, and while I agree that some religious edicts have redeeming qualities, that does not outweigh their dangerousness, not by a long shot. Religion gets its goodness from the inherent kindness of man. It's metabolic for us to want to connect and cooperate with each other. Religion may have served a purpose like alchemy in the past, to impose some order on the frightening Unknown, but it is vestigial now. It should be surgically removed even if, like Neil DeGrasse said, some sliver of us will always believe. That sliver should be rendered politically impotent, so that it stops molesting and sabotaging our country. That's my conviction, acquired through my personal experience. To paraphrase Orwell's *Politics and the English Language*, religion should be mocked into oblivion using every high and low insult possible, so that some poor nerd like me doesn't have to go through the same bullshit I went through.	  	Edit: and by conviction I mean I am dedicating my education to acquiring the tools I need to refute religion at every turn and hopefully contribute to undermining it in some substantial way. I can say with a straight face that I believe I am part of an ideological war, and I am more knowledgeable, more diligent and more prepared than most of my opposition. At this point it seems like it's a very winnable war. My favorite tool is science documentaries. If I see someone is getting interested in science, that's when I know the unraveling will begin soon.","depth":5,"score":21,"ups":21,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cm59nkk","parent_id":"t1_cm57pmm","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1416255266,"created_utc":1416255266}

I have a few atheist friends, and sometimes we disagree about something and we talk about it, but it never gets into a full blown debate. We settle our differences and move on.

Consider, though, a mentally developed adult who rejects reality, redoubles their beliefs when presented with contradicting information, and maintains a myriad of delusions about an all powerful super being setting out the rules for us to live by, a similarly powerful mischief maker trying to trick us into believing things more consistent with the observable universe in order to burn us in a lake of fire for all eternity, and forgiveness of our incestuous forebearers mistakes by blood sacrifices.

Imagine an atheist kills somebody, because he sees that there is no ultimate judgement from a being, so he can get away with it. Should we now call atheism a state of mental illness? Of course not, because we are all not like that.

{"body":"> The human brain is geared to find patterns even where they don't exist.

Indeed this is the case, but what if you encourage children to consistently find what is not real and tell them that it is real.  Children have no way to determine good data from bad, so they tend to accept edicts from parents about what is good and bad.  They are encouraged to convince themselves that they feel the holy spirit, or see Jesus' face on toast, or have prophetic dreams.  That behavior is praised.  And because children are humans that want praise, especially from their parents, many children grow to believe those things are true.		> When you can't distinguish reality from illusion, that's the illness. 		That's not what illness is.  And I believe thinking of it in terms of illness isn't particularly helpful.  There are people that have legitimate mental defects that do prevent them from perceiving reality very well (or at least, significantly worse than average).  Classifying people that have corrupted base assumptions as mentally ill doesn't offer a cure.  You can't offer them drugs to fix brain chemistry gone awry because their brain chemistry isn't awry.  You can't do surgery to correct misfiring neurons, because their neurons aren't misfiring.		> So, a bunch of people believing in religion doesn't make it true. But a bunch of people agreeing to value certain pieces of paper as X, Y, Z, for convenience's sake does make it so, after a certain amount of buy in.		It wasn't intended as a direct analogy but rather to illustrate that we all can assign meaning to something beyond it's real properties.  Empirical values are often ignored by people when dealing with something that we collectively agree has more value.  If the money example doesn't appeal to you, then how about the notion of using dogs as a food source.  Pigs are roughly the same intelligence level as dogs, yet because we often have emotional attachment to dogs (as they are common pets) most people view the notion of using dogs for food as morally repugnant.

Thinking of things as absolute truths is, to my mind, part of the issue.  Human beings are really not well equipped to view even the truths that we do know.  		You've heard the saying "perception is reality" I'd assume?  Well for a lot of humankind, that's the way it works.  We've been raised to perceive some things in some ways and our ability to perceive otherwise is compromised by the cognitive biases that we have both evolved and learned.  A good example is the issue of eating insects.  Insects are actually an excellent source of protein, they're ridiculously easy to farm, and can often even be fed things otherwise considered waste products.  I know this intellectually, but for the life of me, I can't imagine eating bugs without feeling nauseated at the prospect.  This is because all through my childhood I was taught that bugs were icky, and not a convenient snack.		Most theists are raised in homes where they are taught to believe that a god is real, that they have souls, and that heaven and hell are places we go when we die.  They're taught this by people they love and trust and often their friends and family are taught the same thing.  Those that are "good" children and who don't rebel are ironically the ones that tend to propagate their parents' flawed beliefs.		That's not insanity as in "brain working badly", that's just the way humans process information.		> A person with an imaginary friend has exactly the same credibility as any theist believing in their god, their proof both lie solely in their belief.		But you see most of the time religious belief is compartmentalized.  A person that believes in ridiculous things like gods because they were explicitly taught to believe ridiculous things like gods, often has no trouble giving rational and well thought out answers on subjects not related to religion.

I'd encourage you to read up on the [Bayesian cognitive model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function) which appears to be the way we learn things.  To sum up, this model uses established "priors" to evaluate incoming information.  Information that conforms with priors is accepted, while information that contradicts the priors is generally rejected (enough contradictory information can trigger a re-evaluation of the prior).  Young children, however, have no priors.  They're a blank slate.		For this reason children are often thought of as gullible.  That isn't quite correct.  It isn't that children are gullible compared to other children, it's that they have no basis for evaluating data and so they tend to accept what they are told, especially by loved and trusted authorities (like parents and teachers).

The fact that you keep on accentuating "New Atheists" is laughable, and I get the impression that you consider me to fall into that category without having actually asked me for my opinion on if I believe that religion should be tolerated or not. I'll go ahead and answer that for you to clear the air and avoid any further misunderstanding.		I believe a person and their religious idea should remain between themselves and whatever they consider to be their higher power. Organized religion has shown itself time and time again to be a tool for manipulation and to enforce ignorance and complacency among a populace. Even so I do not think that religion should not be tolerated. 		What I do believe however is that every single person should be allowed to openly strive towards attaining greater knowledge. I genuinely believe that if people are allowed to learn and question openly and share ideas for and against religion that they will eventually get to the point where religion effectively has to use the argument of "because it is dogma" and that is where it all breaks down because that is the root of all organized religions.		Dogma and logic are mortal enemies in that logic yearns for solutions and that no truth is irrefutable until it can be proven and dogma simply states that it is truth and that it is irrefutable. As such any logical person that reaches this wall has a choice, the either choose not to peek over the wall into the infinite that is accepting that the answer "I don't know" itself shows a level of profound knowledge and realization, or they refuse to look over the wall instead accepting that the writing on the wall is the truth never questioning if there is more. It is this never questioning that is really the insidious nature of religion, and the reason why it is such a powerful tool for those who choose to utilize it for their own gain.		If someone looks over the wall and chooses to create their own belief then that is between themselves and their belief but it is not formed by organized religion, it is not rooted it ancient text nor manipulative ideology, it is that which religion should be, a personal relationship between one and their higher power formed between yourself, your curiosity and your thirst for knowledge and NOT dogma because nothing is truly irrefutable, not even that higher power.","depth":7,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bunta9186","name":"t1_cm5ftwm","parent_id":"t1_cm5duc7","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1416266543,"created_utc":1416266543}

{"body":"Oh I know they aren't, most of my family is catholic and in my life I'd say a good 70 percent of everyone I have met has been religious and again I'm not trying to insult or try to make those of faith seem like nut jobs. 		Simply, people of religion in accepting, say, an afterlife as a fact (which is kind of the major selling point of most religions) is effectively a delusion. Does it mean that someone who does so cannot be completely practical and sound of mind in other aspects of their life? Absolutely not, I'm not implying that. Just that the belief in it and being willing to dictate how to live your life based on how that will affect you after death is a delusion.		If someone chooses to read the bible, or the quran, or any other religious texts and extract the good in it and use it to help their lives then that is not being religious that is simply being a scholar. It is when people accept blindly the dogmas, the specific of an afterlife, of being judged after death, or the idea that morality is a god given gift and that those without it are explicitly amoral when the delusion is formed. People of faith have varying levels of what they are willing to accept blindly but fundamentally they accept some aspect of their respective doctrine and live with it internally as a fact.		Also a higher power does not necessarily equate to a god nor a false belief and in the case of Einstein I believe I know the letter you are referring to which I have seen refuted on this very sub reddit before. But even ignoring that, saying "there might be a higher power" is not the same as saying "there is a higher power" and honestly I will be the first to absolutely admit to the possibility of a higher power. I will also be right there adding " but at this moment we cannot know and as such I won't presume one way or another".		Really all I am trying to say is that religion as a belief system inherently creates a delusion because of the absolute nature of belief. The fact that someone, instead of being able to honestly say "I don't know", believes that they know is what effectively makes religion, even for the faintest believer, a delusion. The scale of that delusion depends entirely on the person and their ability and willingness to question and their capacity for dealing with the unknown.","depth":5,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"bunta9186","name":"t1_cm540c5","parent_id":"t1_cm533ys","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1416244824,"created_utc":1416244824}

"A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning.

An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder.

And that's the crux of my argument: Being dumb, delusional, or otherwise not connected with fact is not illness until it interferes with life. That's just the basic definition of what mental illness is, according to modern psychology. 		The reason it's not necessarily a "crazy" belief is that we all have delusions. We all have things we assume but have no real basis in our own, factual, experience for. How many of us have ever bothered to measure the speed of light for ourselves, for example? Religiosity is not a condition of mental illness. Never has been. Probably never will be, however much it would be nice to be able to sit down anyone who believes in God and say, "Listen, we need to talk about getting you help." 		I care about topics like this for a number of reasons. I see legitimate suffering due to mental illness every day of my life, that suffering not taken seriously, and then flippant uses of the term, also on a daily basis.

My understanding has been that we're winning the culture war in the US. Young people reject anti-gay bigotry, there's RU486, church attendance is falling, and... some other wins.		I'm thinking that the proper strategy is to call religious beliefs crazy, but not call non-crazy people who hold religious beliefs crazy.
