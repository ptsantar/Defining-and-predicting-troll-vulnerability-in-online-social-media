You being offended can demonstrate the veracity of a *different* consequence that should be acted upon - i.e if you come across an instance of legal slander, and you are additionally offended by it, all that should help you garner justice in a court.

{"body":"> Ehhh, not quite good enough. It's suspicious that the bible is cited as the first source of proof. It's suspect that they make a claim about "almost all biblical scholars" the same way climate change deniers talk about what scientists believe.		No, virtually all biblical scholars think that Jesus was a real person.		The best evidence for this is the fact that the New Testament describes him as crucified. Crucifixion was an extremely shameful way to die and Paul, only 20 years after the event, says that it was considered 'madness' to worship somebody who had been crucified (1 Cor. 1:23). Other ancient sources also report the mockery of Christians for worshipping somebody who had been executed. Why would somebody make that up, then, if it made the religion harder to believe? The best explanation is that Jesus was a real person who was crucified, and this had to be included in the account.		Another good piece of evidence is that Josephus writes of the execution of a Jew named James in 62 CE. So this is pretty good historical evidence that this guy named James existed. If you read this passage, would you think "this James guy probably didn't exist"? 		Later, Josephus describes James as "the brother of Jesus who is called Messiah". Should we have any reason to doubt the existence of this Jesus? Note that Paul also calls James "the Lord's brother" (Gal 1:19). This multiple attestation provides pretty strong evidence that there were two people, Jesus and James, and they were brothers.","depth":8,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"None","name":"t1_cpl5fso","parent_id":"t1_cpl3l40","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426873866,"created_utc":1426870266}

Oh wait, no, I was wrong. This is the  mother of all false dichotomies. How about licking neither because you don't need to and there's nothing to be gained from it?

I strive to be. That's the difference between me and you and theists. I try to be rational in all that I do. I follow the evidence in every part of my life. I am constantly re-evaluating my own beliefs to see if they hold up to scrutiny and if they don't I abandon them. I have gone through huge changes because of this, politically, philosophically, religiously, socially. 		Whether every other atheist is like that I can't say.

Of course there is a rational basis to refuse.		1. There's no reason to lick a toilet seat just because.		2. Toilet seats, while comparatively clean, still carry a risk for being soiled by disgusting things and therefore there's no fucking reason to lick them.		You are acting like licking a toilet seat is like being told you're about to receive a million dollars and there's no rational basis to refuse that. It fucking isn't.

Sure, the Bible contains good lessons (love thy neighbor, don't kill, etc), but it contains an equal number of reprehensible and horrible lessons. Until people are able to separate their moral compass from an outdated, flawed, irrational, and dangerous text, they leave themselves open to following these bad morals. Developing your morals through reasoning and introspection, on the other hand, allows you to form good morals without being persuaded to follow the bad.","depth":10,"score":2,"ups":2,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"makaldenberg","name":"t1_cpklme3","parent_id":"t1_cpkky73","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426821682,"created_utc":1426818082}

Your original statement was:		> As an agnostic, I see staunch atheists and theists as two sides of the same coin: both CHOOSE to BELIEVE that they KNOW about god's existence without strong evidence on either side. To me, both are insanely unreasonable and reckless positions to hold.		We've established that rational, reasonable people really can't choose to believe or disbelieve at will - the ideas they have about reality are determined by the information they are presented with (or not presented with, in the case of absent evidence.) In order for me to *believe* that Bigfoot exists, I'd need to either be presented with a good reason to think such a species exists, or I'd need to suspend the mental faculties that I use to evaluate truth claims - basically I'd need to switch off the rationality centre of my brain.		I have yet to be presented with sufficient credible evidence to think any gods exists. As such, I'm stuck with the default position - the null hypothesis, that gods do not exist. I don't *insist* that this is the case but I'll point to the huge amount of effort expended over the centuries by people *really* wanting gods to exist - even with all their efforts, the best most honest Christians will admit to is "you just have to have faith."		Atheists are the set of people who are *not* theists. If someone gives you a blank piece of paper and asks you to write down all the names of the gods you believe in and you return the page blank - you're an atheist. If someone asks you "do you believe in a god?" and you answer with anything other than "yes" then you're an atheist.		Atheism and agnosticism are not mutually exclusive. Many atheists are both - they sometimes call themselves [*agnostic* atheists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic_atheism), as I do. I can't be reasonably certain that all possible gods don't exist, ***and*** I don't believe gods exist, so together, those two positions mean I'm an agnostic atheist. For some gods (like Yahweh) I'm a gnostic atheist - I'm reasonably confident (to the point of knowing) that the being described in the bible does not exist, for reasons of history and logic and various other reasons (tri-omni gods being logically incoherent is a big reason.)		To recap:		* beliefs aren't usually choices (if they are, then the person isn't operating rationally)	* atheists don't *believe*	* agnostics don't *know*	* you can be both an atheist and an agnostic		Here's a chart: 		[](/definitions)		I hope that addresses your question.","depth":8,"score":4,"ups":4,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"astroNerf","name":"t1_cpknqps","parent_id":"t1_cpkn6oa","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426825728,"created_utc":1426822128}

{"body":"Once again people are different than other animals to me. I'm programmed by biology to feel protective of my kin, and those close to my kin. We're machines built by our genes to further propagate those genes. All life is the same in that regard. 		I can completely acknowledge that all life on earth is fundamentally an expression of the same phenomena, but that rings true for plants as well. [Plants have been shown to react to their surroundings, and react to things that are frightening](http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-01-09/new-research-plant-intelligence-may-forever-change-how-you-think-about-plants), at least frightening to plants. As E.O. Wilson wrote, "The brain [and the mind] exists because it promotes the survival and multiplication of the genes that direct its assembly.", and it appears that while plants don't have brains they have something analogous to be able to do what they do. How can we know if they do or do not have something analogous to minds as well? Both plants and animals show similar reactions to what we define as danger. 		>Mimosa is a plant, which looks something like a fern, that collapses its leaves temporarily when it is disturbed. So Gagliano set up a contraption that would drop the mimosa plant, without hurting it. When the plant dropped, as expected, its leaves collapsed. She kept dropping the plants every five to six seconds.		>"After five or six drops, the plants would stop responding, as if they'd learned to tune out the stimulus as irrelevent," Pollan says. "This is a very important part of learning ??? to learn what you can safely ignore in your environment."		>Maybe the plant was just getting worn out from all the dropping? To test that, Gagliano took the plants that had stopped responding to the drops and shook them instead. 		>"They would continue to collapse," Pollan says. "They had made the distinction that [dropping] was a signal they could safely ignore. And what was more incredible is that [Gagliano] would retest them every week for four weeks and, for a month, they continued to remember their lesson."		I'm curious if you were to find out that plants do feel pain and suffer in a manner similar what would you do? 		Pain is nearly a universal among animals because it's a helpful adaptation. In his book, The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution, biologist Richard Dawkins grapples with the question of why pain has to be so very painful. He describes the alternative as a simple, mental raising of a "red flag". To argue why that red flag might be insufficient, Dawkins explains that drives must compete with each other within living beings. The most fit creature would be the one whose pains are well balanced. Those pains which mean certain death when ignored will become the most powerfully felt. The relative intensities of pain, then, may resemble the relative importance of that risk to our ancestors (lack of food, too much cold, or serious injuries are felt as agony, whereas minor damage is felt as mere discomfort). Why would plants not develop something similar if it's so helpful to animals?		Regardless of how you live you're feeding on life to survive. You lack the ability to turn solar energy into a form usable to yourself so you have to consume those that do. Life feeds on life. My grandfather raised beef, and I've seen the process from life to death. I've been there when a cow is born, through it's growth from calf to adult, when it's killed, and when it's butchered. I've had friends who've raised pigs for food, I've hunted deer and upland game fowl for food, I still fish on regular basis for food, and I'm quite comfortable with all of it. 		I can appreciate a bit of disdain for those who have no idea where their meat comes from. I've lived in places where the vast majority of folks have never been to a ranch or farm, but that isn't me, or even most of the folks where I live.","depth":13,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"Neverborn","name":"t1_cpn39vn","parent_id":"t1_cpmvutu","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1427049537,"created_utc":1427045937}

{"body":"All he does is refuse to accept that plants could have an analogy for pain when it's perfectly reasonable to assume that they may. Now I'm not sure any of this could be said to suggest that plants actually 'feel pain', but the fact that they react to attack and/or damage seems to suggest that plants are perhaps somewhat more advanced than we think. Plants have been around a couple of thousand million years or so longer than animals. They have protected themselves with modified leaves to form thorns and spikes, sharp edge leaves, chemical toxins and communications. They even bleed to protect damaged parts.		Somewhat ironically he states, "First of all, if you're really serious about this and no amount of scientific evidence will sway you" since science does suggest that plants react in the same way as animals that feel pain, and thus there is likely something they feel that is similar to pain if not actually pain as we define it. Emotion, in its most general definition, is a neural impulse that moves an organism to action, prompting automatic reactive behavior that has been adapted through evolution as a survival mechanism to meet a survival need. Plants have all of that except the specific neural channel. They simply use other biochemical and electrical signals. 		Ultimately you can be as unhappy as you want that people eat meat and use animal products, but it will continue to happen into the indefinite future. I eat meat, and my child eats meat, and her children will eat meat. The same is true for my siblings and their children. Our parents are vegetarian, but still consume animal products like eggs and milk.

{"body":"Since I haven't lived your experiences I can't understand how you came to that opinion, but I am curious about your experiences because they are very different from my own. For example, I've never seen religion and science as two forces opposing each other. Historically, the two fields have gotten along well. Some of the great scientific and mathematical minds in history have been religious people who have dedicated their lives to trying to understand the world that their god/gods created. There are some groups who are opposed to science, but from what I can remember that's a recent phenomenon, and one I would say is in the minority globally. I'd also argue that religion isn't a rigid framework at all, but very flexible and open to interpretation, which is how it's managed to stick around for so along. If Christianity was as rigid as you are suggesting, there wouldn't been thousands of sects who have different theologies and interpretations of the religious text and how it applies to the modern world. Now the power structures with in some groups, yes, I could see those as rigid and inflexible (think the Caste system), but that doesn't mean the religion itself is. 			Your second paragraph bothers me. While I can understand frustration with people who use religion as an excuse to just accept their fate and not fight it, I don't think they are in the majority. Especially since you seem to be talking about Christianity. There is an entire branch of theology dedicated to the interpretation of the bible known as Liberation theology that says it is a Christian duty to fight for social and political justice and against power structures that create suffering and oppression. There are also groups, even within the conservative side of Christianity that feel like it is important for humans to accept responsibility of the earth, and work to repair the damage we've done to it. Even groups I strongly disagree with, like dispensational theology and premillennialists who think the earth is fucked, still believe they have power here on earth to help bring about the end of the world by pushing prophecies on foreign policy (not that they have been that successful since Israel isn't eager to start WWIII by destroying the Dome of the Rock to rebuild the Temple). 		Also, I don't know why you thin they don't question. if you read into a lot of theology, a lot of it is people questioning their faith, trying to understand god, thinking for themselves and questioning what they have been taught. Religion is an active, changing thing that people question and re-examine all the time. To suggest that theists just lie down and accept it without any question is doing a huge disservice to the complexity of humans, and it falls into the fallacy of assuming that you have somehow put more thought into this  than others.

Only one of those is a religious belief, and it's not even a widely accepted one by the religion it's from. It's something that a small minority of Christians believe. Also, no science hasn't steadily eroded away at religious beliefs. It's challenged some religious beliefs, but for the most part, religion has adapted to science because most of the main fundamental beliefs of various religions are things that science can't prove or disprove, so there's no reason why religion can't adapt or change to fit with what science discovers.

Being adaptive is not a flaw, it's part of surviving. Culture, people, ideas, interpretations all change over time. That's how things grow. Why should religious people of today be expected to worship and think like those 1000 years ago? The world they are living in and their experiences as humans and members of their religion(s) is different from those that came before them so of course how they worship and how they interpret parts of their religion is going to be different. I don't see how this is a flaw. 			>Humans aren't perfect, another obvious and observable truth that the church refuses to accept.		LMAO What? Are you kidding me? You're talking about Christianity here? The religion whose founding belief is humanity is so flawed and imperfect that God had to send himself down here to die for all our sins because we are that sinful? The religion whose first story in their holy book is about humans fucking up the one command God gave them and ruining it for everyone? The religion that teaches that humans are sinful, and there is nothing that we can do to change that, and we need God's grace to come even remotely close to being good? I'm pretty sure the church is open to the idea that humans aren't perfect, lol. 			>And as far as science working well with religion, that's an illusion made up by hopeful religious folk who think God motivates us to discover the world he's created.

Credibility relies on measurable evidence which religion has not even once produced one piece of. 		Why are you assuming that there is a universal goal for all religions, and that that goal is the same as science's goal. This is a flawed argument. I said that there were well respected religious scientists in the world to show you that there's no reason a religious person cannot be intelligent and that religion and science aren't enemies. Religion and science aren't trying to do the same things, unless science has recently taken on the goal of reaching heaven, moksha, or attaining enlightenment. 			>Science however is built up on a vast foundation of theories backed by massive amounts of evidence through testing and recreating ideas.

Lol, for someone who just accused the church of not being willing to accept humanity's imperfection, you seem to be very quick to do the same thing here.  Science is not flawless. It is not untouchable by frivolous and shallow ideas because scientists are not untouchable by such things. In fact, science has quite a history of being strongly influenced by social and political ideas. For example, scientific racism which incorporated different forms of science and research into proving that non-whites were inferior to western Europeans. This was accepted science by the scientific community. There were people who disagreed with it, but it wasn't denounced as pseudoscience until the late 1940s. It was a branch of science strongly influenced by the politicks of its day, feeding right into the ideal of Imperialism,the superiority of the white race, idea that white people were doing non-whites a favor by colonizing them, enslaving them, stealing their children to reeducate them and destroy their culture. 		Want a more modern example, how about the fact that you need to always be sure to check who funded an experiment before trusting it,because that can have an effect on the results that the scientists get. It's still an issue in modern day science. Studies that get published in peer reviewed journals can be misleading or misrepresentative. 		I want to make myself clear, I'm not saying science is untrustworthy or full of lies, I'm just trying to say that scientists are humans and therefore prone to the same issues of bias, misinformation, mistakes, and being influenced by personal belief as everyone else.

I think specifically the 90% figure is a rhetorical device, to give some sense of scale to the disproportionality of the response he sees. If he were using a figure with more significant digits, like say, 85%, I'd assume that he has some kind of metric he's using to gauge the proportion.		> If no such data exists, then "calling all muslims evil" notwithstanding, dude is nonetheless taking liberties with the truth when he's apparently ~~offen~~angry that others would do the same.		> What on earth could "disproportionate" mean, if it doesn't mean "i don't agree that your reaction is appropriate"		I'm having a hard time discerning why you're looking for such a narrowly-defined epistemology when we're talking about *human emotions,* the one thing in this existence that defies narrow truth-values.		All *I* mean by "disproportionate" is that the reaction is clearly *purely* emotional, when presented with simple, objective facts.		That is, those who are offended are angered by Harris' reporting of objective facts about religion, which he supports using polling data. He lists what he considers a "pernicious belief," citing examples such as supporting the murder of apostates, and the percentages of Muslims that hold these beliefs. The reaction to his reporting of these facts is emotionally charged (hence, affective). This is disproportionate, since a proportionate response should reasonably be expected to be a discussion of the merits of the analysis of what is a pernicious belief, or the validity of the polling data he used as sources. Instead, Afflek went on a 3-minute rant about how Harris was "denigrating Muslims" by making broad generalizations about them.		For clarity, these facts presented by Harris were percentages that were reported by Gallup and Pew in polling Muslims about their beliefs regarding specific matters of violence as they relate to Islam. Specific, objective examples of a trend that shows a "widespread acceptance of these beliefs."		(I'm using this example, because it's the most clearly demonstrative of what I think the OP quote is talking about.)		The anger Harris reports is specifically his reaction to the fact that, generally speaking, he can't effectively report these facts as the beginnings of a rational discussion without the majority of the people he engages entering into what can only be described as emotional outrage that he would *dare* to report these facts. This is a state of affairs that is clearly frustrating, and prevents any real discussion.

We must furthermore account for cases in which *some people, perhaps* ***us,*** *consider the truth or falsity of the offending statement to be self-evident but are mistaken.*		That is why epistemology matters here.","depth":12,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"spazdor","name":"t1_cpkrqpx","parent_id":"t1_cpkrkdy","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426835803,"created_utc":1426832203}

I would probably have to decide which person's assertions were facts.		I'm not sure how this differs from asking which of them is *right*.		That is the core of my objection; I think 'offense' is simply a pejorative word for anger, and 'anger' is simply a more value-neutral (or perhaps entailing a subtle endorsement) word for offense. There are many people on both sides of the worldview divide, who imagine that the others are the ones who are offended, that they're letting their emotions get the better of them, whereas their own emotional response is fundamentally different because it is well-justified.

{"body":"I disagree.		My basis for determining which is offense is based on the nature of the *cause* of the emotional outburst, and based on my reading of Sam Harris' comments, I take his position to be similar: Offense is taken when an emotional outburst (not necessarily negative, simply emotional) is a result of a *mere propositional fact.* Anger, being the more general emotion, is less specifically directed at any proposition, and more generally toward a situation.		I don't think offense is a pejorative for anger, but rather a *more specific emotion* that is of a *purely* reactionary nature, and that, generally speaking, is more directly focused on specific propositional statements.		For example, [this brief exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2zmwzj/as_an_atheist_i_am_angry_that_we_live_in_a/cpkn6w2?context=4) on this post. The reaction about the stereotype being "hate [directed] toward the South" is *taking offense* at a propositional statement. It is a specific type of anger, directed solely at the simple, generalized statement to the effect that "fundamentalists live in the South."		"Anger" is far more general than that. I am *angered* that Sam Harris' comments on Real Time a few months ago were so severely skewed and misconstrued by Cenk Uygur as to distort Harris' comments into an offensive comment about Muslim people. I was not *offended* by it, because my anger is not directed at the specific comments Cenk makes about it, but at a more general trend of comments like Harris' being offensively (or, rather, pejoratively) recast as islamophobia.		It feels bizarre trying to explain and clarify emotions like this, since I have never in my life been in the position of doing so to the extent that you've asked of me.

But at the very least, in cases where religions make claims that can neither be proven nor disproven, they are guilty of perpetuating a seriously flawed epistemology that values belief based on unsound reasoning and insufficient evidence. Religion and irreligion are not on equal intellectual footing any more than geocentrism and heliocentrism. Stop pretending like they are.		>Maybe the time has or will come for outright intolerance of religions		"Intolerance" is a loaded word. If you're talking about outlawing religion, accosting religious people, discriminating against them, or putting them in concentration camps, I'm against that. If you're talking about subjecting religious people to the normal rules of discourse (e.g. religious fairy tales are no longer given the special privilege of being immune from criticism, and are treated with the same degree of skepticism as any other claim), then I'm all for that, and I object to your notion that it's "intolerant."		It is not intolerant to criticize beliefs. Criticism and argument are a fundamental part of how humans arrive at truth in a sea of falsehoods. Take a look at how much arguing and criticizing goes on in the sciences and social sciences as an invaluable, fundamental part of the process. Criticism and argumentation are not viewed as bad things by truth-seekers. They are only viewed as bad by lovers of falsehood, who insist on playing the "hurt feelings" and "sacred beliefs" card, and make it taboo to criticize.		>it's important to recognize how it is seen.		Why should that be of concern to anyone? Again, are you concerned with how geocentrists, flat-earthers, and conspiracy theorists feel about our rejection of their claims? Truth does not care about your feelings. Truth has nothing whatsoever to do with your feelings.		>One definitely cannot do this sort of thing and then get mad when religious people do too		I think you're extremely confused about our complaints with religion. One of our complaints is that religion encourages people to believe in claims based upon a demonstrably specious epistemology, and that those beliefs then have consequences in the public sphere. Our beef with religion is *not* that they engage in public debate, demonstrate skepticism towards secularism, or criticize atheists. Again, I think you're very confused here about why we criticize religion, and are drawing a false equivalence based upon that confusion.		>only, we're the correct ones, right? 		Yes. Believe it or not, it actually matters who's correct. Please stop trying to make this about "feelings." They have no place in a discussion about what's true or not true. It is not my job to tip-toe around someone's delicate sensibilities because they've unwisely sanctified ludicrous dogmas and made them the cornerstone of their identity. If you do this, you're gonna have a bad time. Reality cares not for your sacred beliefs or hurt feelings.","depth":3,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"SargeantSpike","name":"t1_cpkxehx","parent_id":"t1_cpksedg","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426859000,"created_utc":1426855400}

This does not mean that you are taking the opposite stance and saying God doesn't exist (another "truth" claim). It is merely addressing one prong of the argument. 		For example, if you are on trial, the jury will be instructed to come to a determination of guilt, or non-guilt ("we find the defendant not-guilty"), not guilt or innocence.  That doesn't necessarily mean that a not-guilty verdict equals innocence. It simply means that the standard of evidence is insufficient to assess someone as guilty (again, a "truth" claim).

It is more than statistically significant to cause something actionable.		Yes, part of the scientific method is to keep searching for that one case that counters existing evidence. That allows for refinement of the existing theories, that's how we came from Aristotle's five elements to 110+ elements in the periodic table. If we don't keep searching for that evidence exception, we will never improve our understanding. But yeah, the theory with evidence reigns as the accepted theory where as the theory without evidence is not favored...		Sure, you round down a lot of variables to zero in a lot of cases, but it depends on the hypothesis, the system, the experiment. 		To make a statement that "there is a living human on earth who is 5000 years old" and say that you can't disprove it is accurate until you have measured every single human's age that has every existed and proven otherwise. (exhaustive search).			Or you take a statistically significant sample use that to conclude that it's not true, but in this case you conclude it with a *confidence level*, accepting that since we did not exhaustively search there could be a chance that the claim could be true afterall. 			For all practical purposes for doing something actionable, with your conclusion, you could then proceed to follow the conclusion if you think that the confidence level is high enough. But, to do something actionable is upto the acting party. You say that a guy who is going against the conclusion is a fool and risk being labelled as an arrogant , disrespectful asshole.

{"body":"So...this feels like clickbait and this is definitely the wrong /sub/ for this, BUT....I guess I want more people to act as if things like the ten commandments are important. And by like, I don't mean follow dogmatically, but live life according to the motto "don't be a dick, and try and be nice." But that's an active emotional approach to the world. It doesn't inform what is scientifically true and untrue, it means actively living a good life and having a strong emotional connection to that life.		I'm sort of religious sort of not. I don't believe in any of the Abrahamic religions, but at the same time I can find no scientific justification for free will. Which means that we are moved by physics beyond us, and that speculation into the meaning of how we are capable of feeling and what that feeling "is" is not irrational. This feeling among atheists would probably be called theistic, and among theists it would be heretical, but as far as I can tell this realization has caused me to have a deep emotional connection to everything around me. I don't want to call it 'spiritual' because that feels like it has too much baggage. I really don't know what to call it. 		This philosophy has taught me to be nicer to people and live in awe of the world around me. It has helped me reflect on how I am the way I am and how life and the outside world has shaped my identity. I think that atheists often feel identified by their atheism in part as a push back against those that have religious feeling and have in the past persecuted them. I don't think every atheist feels this way but I think that maybe some do. I think many theists, but not all, confuse their dogma for the "answer", to what I don't know, and forget that the most important thing is to be kind. 		But of both atheists and theists alike I wish there were more actions guided by the feeling of what is right and what makes the world happy, rather than what is easy and costs little. I'm a little high right now, so I might not be making very much sense, but whenever I see an /atheism/ thread this is what I think about.","depth":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"pchancharl","name":"t1_cpkpqqn","parent_id":"t3_2zmwzj","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426830117,"created_utc":1426826517}

In any case, *it's just a word.* Arguing against his usage of it isn't the same as arguing with the points he raises.		>For me there is a hard line between spiritualism and atheism.		But again, it depends on what you're talking about when using the word "spiritual", and again, atheism doesn't guarantee rationality or skepticism. 		People can become atheists for completely irrational reasons, they just tend not to - and for someone who appears to have such ire for the mixed meanings of terms, you seem to have no trouble twisting the meaning of terms to suit your specific usage.		>If his big revelation is that "over there those feelings peace and well being associated with spirituality are really just chemical reactions".

{"body":">You don't get my point.		I'm awaiting the emergence of one.		>He is trying to create a new category.		...of what?		He's talking about something that people are already talking about, he's just approaching it differently; he won't dismiss the importance of some subjective experiences as most atheists do, and won't use subjectivity as the epistemic basis of anything outside of subjectivity, like most religionists do.		If you can explain how that is somehow intellectually unsustainable, you might finally be approaching a cogent counterpoint.		>Unconnected Latin and Greek origins, aka pretentious BS.		Are you still agonizing over the word "spiritual"? If it presents such an insurmountable conceptual hurdle for you to clear in order to engage with what he's written on the topic, just pretend he's using a different word - it really isn't a central part of his work, *it's just what he's chosen to call it.*		Like I've said multiple times now, I disagree with his twisted usage of the term too, but it doesn't impact upon the content of his book.		>Ultimately he is locked into saying spiritual, mystical, religious, epiphanies and all the rest are complex chemical reactions in the brain not attributable to the divine or supernatural. Just SCIENCE!		*...again I doubt he would disagree on this point, but much of what he's railing against in his writing is felt in your usage of the word* **"just".**		**Recognizing that all mental states share the same neurophysiolgical underpinnings doesn't somehow dictate that we treat all mental states as being fundamentally equal. They aren't. And assigning all mentality to be nothing more significant than the sum of electrochemical events - even though that's what they are - is reductive to say the least.**		And frankly, it's arrogant; we're on solid ground relentlessly challenging the existence of the supernatural, but we have no basis on which to say that people who believe that sort of crap can't *really* be happier or more fulfilled than people generally tend to be as a result, even if their joy is founded in lies and fairy tales.		>This trite, trivial, and obvious...		Again, you say trivial - but I'm curious; if the most important subjective experiences humans are capable of undergoing are "trivial", I'm curious as to what might clear your bar for revelatory insight.		>...an elaborate tautology.		For someone who is so irked by specific uses of language, you seem to have a knack for twisting words without a sense of irony.		Nothing about his analysis of mental states is rhetorically tautologous. Merely declaring it as so proves nothing.

But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time."		In 1958, Russell elaborated on the analogy as a reason for his own atheism:		"I ought to call myself an agnostic; but, for all practical purposes, I am an atheist. I do not think the existence of the Christian God any more probable than the existence of the Gods of Olympus or Valhalla. To take another illustration: nobody can prove that there is not between the Earth and Mars a china teapot revolving in an elliptical orbit, but nobody thinks this sufficiently likely to be taken into account in practice.

{"body":"Ok thanks for the reply but do provide more examples of where I am being dishonest.	As far as Waking Up - I may have exaggerated a bit when I said every paragraph in Waking Up starts with religion sucks but I certainly found a lot of it in there and was surprised to find it in there and annoyed because I had hoped to find in the book a new way of looking at the world and instead found just a criticism of an old view.  I don't know, atheism isn't new to me, I haven't just discovered it, I've encountered those arguments since a child and really don't need to keep going over them.  	And then as far as atheism as a religion - I asked the question in seriousness because I'm not convinced it's not.  And I've tried outlining those reasons: there is a lot of passion and emotions on the atheist side, a lot of self-righteousness, judgments, superiority, and certainly a lot of us in the atheist club versus those unenlightened religious morons.  And I'm proposing the argument that since atheism is based around the belief (because we can't know) that there is nothing beyond what we see, the universe just exists, it came about out of nothing etc it is a religion.  I also made the distinction that I wouldn't call agnosticism a religion because there is less of a system of belief around that, agnostics don't claim to know anything.  As far as the a-Muslim example - if you focused your whole belief system around how Islam is a lie and not true then yes I would call you an a-Muslim.  However if you just don't think it's true and kind of stop there then no, you're not an a-Anything.  I suppose it comes down to degrees and how actively you don't believe something...So I suppose someone who doesn't believe in a supernatural being doesn't necessarily have to be of the atheist religion but if they start focusing on that as I see many atheists do, then yes I am tempted to make the argument that yes, atheism can be a religion.  But I remain open to arguments against this proposition.	Where else was I being dishonest?  I wasn't trying to be and would like to clarify anything that may have been interpreted as such.","depth":10,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"3k33random52k6","name":"t1_cpl5ui4","parent_id":"t1_cpl1msp","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426874508,"created_utc":1426870908}
{"body":">Where else was I being dishonest?		You've been told multiple times that atheism is not a belief system, it's been spelled out plainly several times. You are lumping things on to "atheism" and then just calling it "atheism." It would be like saying "Christians drive cars therefore, part of Christianity is driving cars."		There isn't any point in explaining it further since you haven't acknowledged what atheism actually is yet. You've created a definition that no one uses and are trying to argue from that point. People point out the flaws and you continue to do so. It's dishonest and not how you carry a discussion.		Lack of belief is not a belief. Answering the question "do you think big foot is real" with a "no" does not make it a religion.		To take this final point a bit further, atheism has no tenets, no dogma, no belief structure. Every other belief that isn't about the existence of a god **is not atheism.** Materialism isn't atheism, moral relativism isn't atheism, and so on and so forth.","depth":11,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"hedgeson119","name":"t1_cpl6j45","parent_id":"t1_cpl5ui4","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426875606,"created_utc":1426872006}
{"body":"Oh it's "spelled out" is it?  And "I've been told" have I?  This is sounding awfully "dogmatish" to me at this point.  I'm trying to question the dogma that is that atheism isn't a religion because I'm failing to see the difference lately and everyone is trying to "spell things out" for me that things aren't dogmatic...I'm confused.		I already addressed the point about lack of belief not being a belief.  I'm making the case that it can be:		Just saying you don't believe in Islam isn't a belief in a-Islam.  But focusing your world view around how Islam is not true would be (IMO).  Same with big foot if you need to use that example.  So no, just saying "I don't believe in god is not a religion but calling yourself an atheist, banding together and then proceeding to call anyone who disagrees a "them" who is "deluded" and "irrational" sounds hypocritical and very much like the religions you are all criticizing.  		Big Foot and Santa are things that can be proven and disproven to a higher degree.  We can kind of go to the North Pole, wait for him on Christmas etc. Similarly for Jesus and Moses. But that nothing beyond what we have thus far seen exists?  You are making claims about which you can't have knowledge about and therefore those claims have to be beliefs, by definition.		Spell it out again how being certain about there not existing a higher power which created the universe isn't a belief for me please because I don't understand.  And while you're at it spell out atheism for me.","depth":12,"score":1,"ups":1,"downs":0,"controversiality":0.0,"gilded":false,"author":"3k33random52k6","name":"t1_cpl9vtr","parent_id":"t1_cpl6j45","subreddit":"atheism","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","created":1426880937,"created_utc":1426877337}

This is written in a way I'm having problems following, you may be mixing atheism with anti-theism... The latter of which is the opinion that religious beliefs are harmful.		>You are making claims about which you can't have knowledge about		Define knowledge.		>Spell it out again how being certain about there not existing a higher power which created the universe		Who said anything about certainty?		>And while you're at it spell out atheism for me.		I know I've personally said this like twice now. Let me define it **one** more time.		**Atheism is the lack of belief in god(s).**		That is the most general definition, and the one usually used by atheists here on Reddit. If you define it in any other way, add anything thing else other than that too the word, you are not using it how most people here use it. And they will call you out on it. If you continue to label people as something they are not, would you expect them to act charitably?
