This repository contains the dataset used for the experiments in the paper "Defining and Predicting Troll Vulnerability in Social Media" published in Social Network Analysis and Mining.

The dataset contains posts from the Reddit social network website.The site is a collection of entries,called submissions, posted by registered users. Submissions are organized into categories, called subreddits. Once a user posts a submission to a subreddit, users post comments on this submission. Users then respond to these comments and conversation trees are formed whose roots are the submissions. We consider 18 subreddits and retrieved 20 popular and 20 controversial submissions and the corresponding comments from each of these subreddits.
